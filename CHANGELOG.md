Well, it's been a while...

Sorry for that long delay, but this update should make it up a little :)

## 0.4 update
### What's new:

* New Tweak: "Wandering Trader Horn",

this allows you to blow the "sing" horn every 2 days to summon a wandering trader. 

Wandering traders will still spawn naturally. You can disable the "doTraderSpawning" gamerule if you don't want them to.

* Made tall flowers spawn a little more with "Bee Tall Flower Duplication".
* Added "Minor Inconvenience" mode, this makes the player explode after taking **any** damage.
* Made "Temperature Based Crop Growth Speed" data-driven, checkout [this](https://github.com/melontini/m-tweaks/blob/1.19-fabric/src/main/resources/data/m-tweaks/mt_crop_temperatures/crops/minecraft_wheat.json) for an example and more info. oh... and this rename I guess. (I might've forgotten a few plants, please report back if you find any ;) )
* "Spawner Minecart" is now "Minecart with Spawner" and entity inside is now displayed as a tooltip.
* TNT Boat had a minor rework, now it should be a little more stable but equally chaotic.
* You can also use "Flint and Steel" and Fire Charge to light the fuse. The fuse's timer is 50 + from 0 to 20 ticks.
* Added "Balanced Mending" tweak. this makes mending a bit less OP by making it remove the "Too Expensive" error instead of repairing items via XP.
* and yes, this is inspired by TheMisterEpic's "This Minecraft Enchantment has been BROKEN for 3 YEARS..." video.
* Added ???
