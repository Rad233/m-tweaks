## 0.4.5 update
### What's new:

* New tweak! Auto-generate recipe advancements.
  * This try to generate advancements for every recipe in the game.
* New tweak! Slightly Better Item Names.
  * Shows item durability (in %) if durability is < 100% or item count if count is > 1
* New category! "Bug Fixes", kind of ironic.
  * Currently, contains 2 options.
  * Frame-Independent Advancement Shadow
  * and Properly Aligned Recipe Alternatives
* Added an item group for all currently enabled items. The Icon is pretty fancy.
* Removed Smooth Tooltips, since they were kind of hacky and assumed that there can be only 1 tooltip at a time. Also, they completely broke in 1.19.3.
* This version no longer guarantees compatibility with 1.19.1. I'm also no longer going to backport things to 1.18.2.
* Migrated a bunch of internal things to cracker-util. If you use Recipe Book is Pain, you will need to wait for that to update too.
* Updated to Fabric API 0.69.0.

1.19.3 should be coming soonish.

Hope you enjoy!
