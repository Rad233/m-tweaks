### What's New:

* Fixed a number of issues with Throwable Items datapacks.
* * You can now add multiple behaviors per item.
* * Now `complement` is true by default.
* * Added the `spawn_item_particles` parameter. If false, prevents item particles from being spawned. True by default.
* * Added the `cooldown` parameter. Allows you to set a custom cooldown.
* * Added `override_vanilla` parameter. If true, prevents **ALL** vanilla behaviors from being executed. This should never be used on block items, as it will make the block unplaceable.
* New Tweak! `/damage` backport. Not exact copy of the command, but still pretty useful.
* m-tweaks now collects analytic data, obviously you can turn it off. Data sent: 
* * Mod version, Minecraft version, OS, Java version, and current config.
