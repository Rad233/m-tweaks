## 0.4.2 update
### What's new:

This is a pretty small release.
I just thought that I should fix a few issues while I'm working on a new mod.

* A new tweak: Clock Tooltip! This one shows in-game-time inside the clock's tooltip.
* Added an ability to open Hopper Boat's inventory whilst swimming in it.
* Now jukebox boats & minecarts will show rainbow text after inserting a music disc.
* Fixed a bug where TNT boats' fuse times weren't read from nbt correctly.
* Fixed anvil limits when using Balanced Mending. _~~How~~_
* Removed italic formatting from mod's tooltips.
* Removed the hidden "egg slot" from the incubator.
