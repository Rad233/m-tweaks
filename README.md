# Current Tweaks

Every tweak is configurable, so you can disable anything you don't like

## World Tweaks

### Falling Bee Nests (on by default)

Randomly, bee nests will fall from their trees making bees inside homeless & if any player is nearby, very angry.

* the gif is sped up btw.

In my tests it usually takes 0-2 days for a nest to fall

Arrows also work!

### Crops Grow Slower in Cold Biomes (off by default)

Currently, not very configurable. I do plan on allowing you to choose which crops don't like cold and which ones do. 

[Put a cool crop montage here]

## Block Tweaks

### Beds Explode Everywhere (off by default)

A joke tweak making beds explode in the overworld.

### Safe Beds (off by default)

Makes beds NOT explode when outside the overworld. Instead, sends the player a friendly message.

### Leaf Slowdown (off by default)

Makes it difficult to traverse biomes atop of trees, by slowing entities down when on leaves.

### Campfire Effects (on by default)

Gives players configurable effects when in a configurable range to a campfire.

## Entity Tweaks

### Better Furnace Minecart (on by default)

Makes a few changes to furnace mine carts to make them a bit better.

- Fuel is now saved as an Integer.

- You can now configure cart's max allowed fuel. (45000 by default, 2147483647 max)

- The same fuel you can use in a normal furnace is now usable in minecarts with furnace.

### New Minecarts (on by default)

- Anvil Minecart, it's slow. Woo-Hoo!

- Note Block Minecart.

- Jukebox Minecart.

## Item Tweaks

### Minecart Block Picking

Allows you to "pick up" blocks using minecarts. All contents and some properties are copied to the cart.

For the sake of balance, you can configure if players can "pick up" spawners.
