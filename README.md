# m-tweaks
A minecraft mod providing various tweaks &amp; features

# Current Tweaks

Every tweak is configurable, so you can disable anything you don't like

## World Tweaks

### Falling Bee Nests (on by default)

Randomly, bee nests will fall from their trees making bees inside homeless & if any player is nearby, very angry.

### Crops Grow Slower in Cold Biomes (off by default)

Currently, not very configurable. I do plan on allowing you to choose which crops don't like cold and which ones do.

## Block Tweaks

### Beds Explode Everywhere (off by default)

A joke tweak making beds explode in the overworld.

[you know the drill]

### Bed Explosion Power (5.0 by default)

:)

### Safe Beds (off by default)

Makes beds NOT explode when outside the overworld. Instead, sends the player a friendly message.

### Leaf Slowdown (off by default)

Makes it difficult to traverse biomes atop of trees, by slowing entities down when on leaves.

### Campfire Effects (on by default)

Gives players configurable effects when in a configurable range to a campfire.

## Entity Tweaks

### Better Furnace Minecart (on by default)

Makes a few changes to furnace mine carts to make them a bit better.

- Fuel is now saved as an Integer.

- You can now configure cart's max allowed fuel. (45000 by default, 2147483647 max)

- The same fuel you can use in a normal furnace is now usable in minecarts with furnace.

### New Minecarts (on by default)

- Anvil Minecart, it's slow. Woo-Hoo!

- Note Block Minecart.

- Jukebox Minecart.

## Item Tweaks

### Minecart Block Picking

Allows you to "pick up" blocks using minecarts.

For the sake of balance, you can configure if players can "pick up" spawners.
